**Key Issues**:
- Over-engineered architecture with multiple overlapping APIs
- High cognitive load due to complex patterns
- Missing critical production features
- Performance concerns with singleton patterns

**Strengths**:
- Excellent test coverage (98.97%)
- Strong type safety with Pydantic

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Priority: HIGH)

### 1. API Simplification

**Problem**: Multiple overlapping APIs create confusion and maintenance burden.

**Current State**:
```python
# Too many ways to do the same thing
AgentFactory(DefaultState).with_chat(...).build()
AgentBuilder(DefaultState).with_step("llm", ...).build()
```

**TODO Checklist**:
- [ ] **Create single `Agent` class** to replace both `AgentFactory` and `AgentBuilder`
- [ ] **Design unified fluent API** that combines best of both approaches
- [ ] **Update all examples** to use new unified API
- [ ] **Update documentation** to reflect new API

### 2. Architectural Complexity Reduction

**Problem**: Over-engineered patterns create unnecessary complexity.

**TODO Checklist**:
- [ ] **Remove `AgentBuilderDirector`** - unnecessary abstraction layer
- [ ] **Merge `ToolFactory` and `ToolRegistry`** into single `ToolManager` class
- [ ] **Simplify step strategies** - current implementation is overkill for most use cases
- [ ] **Reduce configuration objects** from 7+ to 3-4 core configs
- [ ] **Eliminate `StateTypeFactory`** complexity - use simpler type handling
- [ ] **Remove singleton patterns** where not absolutely necessary
- [ ] **Simplify YAML integration** - make it consistent with programmatic API
- [ ] **Reduce cognitive load** by eliminating unnecessary abstractions

### 3. Missing Critical Features
