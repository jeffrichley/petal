1. Flesh out AgentFactory’s “pluggable behaviors”
Complete these in roughly the order they’re listed—each builds on the previous:

.with_chat()
Wire in your LLM client (e.g. LangChain chat wrapper), storing whatever chat-session object or model handle your Agent will invoke during .run().

.with_memory()
Add a strategy for persisting or recalling past state (e.g. an in-memory buffer or external vector store).

.with_logger()
Hook up structured logging of inputs, outputs, and intermediate state for debugging or audit trails.

.with_state()
Enforce a Pydantic schema (or similar) on the shared state dict before/after each step.

.with_condition()
Allow users to register a predicate so a step only runs when condition(state) is truthy.

.with_retry(n)
Wrap a step in retry logic (exponential back-off or fixed delay).

.with_timeout()
Enforce per-step timeouts—e.g. cancel or skip if a step takes too long.

.with_tool_registry()
Inject your ToolFactory instance so steps can lookup tools by name.

.with_mcp_proxy()
Shorthand for calling tool_factory.add_mcp(...) under the covers.

.as_node()
Package this fully-configured Agent as a LangGraph node—returning whatever node object GraphFactory expects for .add_agent().

Once those are in place, you can ▷

Hook up GraphFactory (using .as_node()) to start wiring multi-agent flows, and

Layer on Extras (e.g. from_config, dev-mode toggles) and ToolFactory discovery.

Why finish AgentFactory first?
It’s the heart of your orchestration.

Having a fully-featured AgentFactory makes writing integration tests and example graphs much easier.

ToolFactory and GraphFactory both depend on .with_chat(), .with_tool_registry(), and .as_node() to integrate cleanly.

Let me know which of these you’d like to tackle first, or if you want a deep dive—say, on wiring up the LLM client for .with_chat()!
